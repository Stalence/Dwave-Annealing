# Simulated Annealing for the Dwave One problem

The goal of this was to write a simulated annealing algorithm that in a certain (restricted) sense, outperforms the DWave One machine at the problem of finding the ground state of the Ising spin glass model. This was the optional assignment of the fall 2013 offering of
 Berkeley's Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation online course.
