# Simulated Annealing for the Dwave One problem

The goal of this was to write a classical algorithm(Simulated annealing) that in a certain(restricted) sense, outperforms the DWave One machine at 
problem of finding the ground state of the Ising spin glass model. This was the optional assignment of the fall 2013 offering of
 Berkeley's Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computation online course.
